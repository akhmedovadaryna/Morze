As authors may be supposed to know better than anyone else what
they intended to do when writing a book, I beg leave to say that
there is no moral to this story. Rose is not designed for a model
girl, and the Sequel was simply written in fulfillment of a promise,
hoping to afford some amusement, and perhaps here and there a
helpful hint, to other roses getting ready to bloom.
